/* There are 4 types of joins in SQL. An inner join, left join, right join, and a "full" outer join. 
An inner join occurs when you create a table from two existing tables that only contains matching values. 
A left join keeps all of the information from the original left table and adds in the matching values from the right table. 
A right join is the exact opposite of the left join (original right table gets added on to with matching values)
An outer or full join keeps all the records where there is a match from either the left or right table.  

For the yarn and vendor tables, it seems that a left join was used, with the vendor table being the one on the left.
